# BluetoothDevicesApp
This project is aimed to produce apps for Windows <sup>[[1]](#footnote1)</sup> and Android (and maybe iOS, Linux and macOS in the future) which supercharges your current headphones and also other bluetooth gadgets.

The first fully supported devices will be the following:
- Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro
- Sony WH-1000XM3

Eventual Devices for the future:
- all other Samsung Glaxy Buds
- Sony WH-1000XM4
- Honor Band 3
- Honor MagicWatch 2
- JBL Charge 3
- Bose SoundLink Mini
- Soundcore Liberty Air 2
- Soundcore Life Q30
- JBL Free (X)

Generally this project aims to support all bluetooth devices out there.
Some functions thought will be limited to fully supported devices and only eventually will work with non tested devices.
Some functions will have a lower user experience with non fully supported devices.

## Features

Currently implemented app features:

If this project may really booms, I may think about bringing it officially to the App Stores.
